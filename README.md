# MSP430_FPGA_Voltage-Measurement
Function 1: Sinmoid signals measurement: Vpp from 20 to 50mV, frequency from 10Hz to 1KHz, relative error ≤ 10%
Function 2: Use four 7-bit segment tubes to display measured Vpp and Frequency
Function 3: Use Key to select Vpp/Freq display; refreshing time ≤ 2s with stable measured result
Function 4: Change input signal to square wave and sawtooth wave with same requirements as 1, 2, 3. Tell and mark different waves by LED display
