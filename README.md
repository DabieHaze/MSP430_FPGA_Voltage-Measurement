# FPGA_Signal-Measurement

Hardware：
FPGA

Software:
Quartus II

Language:
VHDL

Function 1: Sinmoid signals measurement: Vpp from 20 to 50mV, frequency from 10Hz to 1KHz, relative error ≤ 10%

Function 2: Use four 7-bit segment tubes to display measured Vpp and Frequency

Function 3: Use Key to select Vpp/Freq display; refreshing time ≤ 2s with stable measured result

Function 4: Change input signal to square wave and sawtooth wave with same requirements as 1, 2, 3. Tell and mark different waves by LED display
